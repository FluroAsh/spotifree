Spotifree is an application built with React and uses the Spotify API in order to retrieve artist data based on the users search query, and represent this in a visual layout.

It was designed to be simple, and mainly as an experiment in working with the Spotify API as-well as representing this data in a grid layout with responsive media queries.
